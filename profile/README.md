# ☁️ zoph.io · AWS Infra & Security Expertise

Hi, I’m Victor — an independent AWS Cloud Architect based in Paris, France. I help teams build **secure**, **cost-efficient**, and **automated** AWS environments.

This GitHub org is where I publish tools, scripts, and resources I use in real-world client projects to improve AWS security, visibility, and operations.

---

## 🔐 What I Do

- Design and audit **secure cloud architectures**
- Implement **DevSecOps pipelines** and IaC workflows
- Build **automated monitoring** and **alerting** for AWS environments
- Reduce **cloud waste** through asset visibility and smart automation

If you're working with AWS and care about **security**, **compliance**, and **efficiency** — you're in the right place.
